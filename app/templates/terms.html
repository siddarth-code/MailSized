    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> [Insert Date]</p>

    <p>Welcome to <strong>MailSized</strong> (“<strong>we</strong>”, “<strong>us</strong>”, “<strong>our</strong>”). These Terms &amp; Conditions (“<strong>Terms</strong>”) govern your access to and use of our website, apps, and related services (collectively, the “<strong>Service</strong>”). By using the Service, you agree to these Terms.</p>

    <h2>1. The Service</h2>
    <p>MailSized lets you upload a video, compress it to fit common email-attachment limits (e.g., Gmail 25&nbsp;MB, Outlook 20&nbsp;MB), and receive a download link via email and on the site. We may offer optional add-ons such as priority processing or transcripts.</p>

    <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You must be at least 13 years old (or the age of digital consent in your region).</li>
      <li>If you use the Service on behalf of an organization, you confirm you have authority to bind that organization.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Your Content &amp; License</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>You own your content.</strong> You grant us a limited, non-exclusive, worldwide license to host, transcode, process, and deliver your uploaded files solely to provide the Service to you.</li>
      <li>You represent and warrant you have all rights needed to upload and process the content, and that your use doesn’t violate any law or third-party rights.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Upload Limits, Retention, &amp; Deletion</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Current soft limits: up to 2&nbsp;GB per upload and ~20 minutes duration (subject to change).</li>
      <li><strong>Retention:</strong> Source uploads are typically deleted within ~30 minutes of processing completion or failure. Compressed outputs are typically deleted within ~24 hours after they are made available for download.</li>
      <li>We do not create backups of your files; please retain your own copies.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Acceptable Use</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>No unlawful, infringing, harassing, defamatory, harmful, or abusive content.</li>
      <li>No malware, viruses, scripts, or attempts to disrupt or overload the Service.</li>
      <li>No scraping, reverse engineering, or bypassing of technical measures.</li>
      <li>We may suspend or terminate access for violations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Payments, Pricing &amp; Taxes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Payments are processed by <strong>Stripe</strong>. We don’t store full card details.</li>
      <li>Prices may vary by file size tier and add-ons and may change at any time. Taxes (e.g., VAT, sales tax) may apply.</li>
      <li><strong>All sales are final</strong> and non-refundable except where required by law or where we explicitly state otherwise.</li>
      <li>Chargebacks or payment disputes may result in account or service suspension.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We rely on third-party providers such as hosting (e.g., Render), payments (Stripe), email delivery (e.g., Mailgun), analytics/ads (e.g., Google). Your use of those services may be subject to their terms in addition to ours.</p>

    <h2>8. Service Availability &amp; Changes</h2>
    <p>We strive for high availability but do not guarantee uninterrupted Service. We may modify, suspend, or discontinue any aspect of the Service at any time without liability to you.</p>

    <h2>9. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>All Service software, branding, and content (excluding your uploads) are owned by us or our licensors and protected by law. These Terms do not transfer any rights except the limited license in Section&nbsp;3.</p>

    <h2>10. DMCA / Copyright Complaints</h2>
    <p>If you believe content processed via our Service infringes your copyright, please email <strong>contact@mailsized.com</strong> with: (a) your contact info; (b) description of the work; (c) the infringing material; (d) good-faith statement; and (e) a statement under penalty of perjury that you’re authorized to act. We may remove or disable access to reported material and/or terminate repeat infringers.</p>

    <h2>11. Disclaimers</h2>
    <p><strong>THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE.”</strong> We disclaim all warranties, express or implied, including fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, and accuracy. We do not guarantee specific compression outcomes, delivery times, or that email systems will accept a given attachment.</p>

    <h2>12. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, our total liability for any claim relating to the Service shall not exceed the greater of (a) the amounts you paid to us for the Service in the three (3) months preceding the event giving rise to liability, or (b) USD&nbsp;$100. We are not liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, loss of data, or business interruption.</p>

    <h2>13. Indemnification</h2>
    <p>You agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from any claims, damages, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising from your content or your breach of these Terms or applicable law.</p>

    <h2>14. Termination</h2>
    <p>You may stop using the Service at any time. We may suspend or terminate the Service or your access immediately if you breach these Terms or if we must do so to comply with law.</p>

    <h2>15. Governing Law &amp; Dispute Resolution</h2>
    <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of [Your State/Country], excluding conflicts of law rules. The exclusive venue for any dispute shall be the state or federal courts located in [Your County/State], and you consent to their jurisdiction.</p>

    <h2>16. Changes to Terms</h2>
